             <p>Fabestine Design process is focus and result oriented.
               Here below are our five stages of design process:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
                   <p>We start by getting to know you and your business.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <h3>Design</h3>
                   <p>Next, we craft a unique core concept that will shape the
                     direction and feel of your design. We go through a series
                     of design phases to create a unique eye-catching design
                     your customers simply won’t be able to ignore. At this
                     stage, revisions are done until the client approves it.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <h3>Development</h3>
                   <p>Once the design is approved, we’ll start the production.
                     This is a stage where the website itself is actually
                     created. The best part – your project never leaves our
                     office. So you can rest assured knowing your project will
                     be flawless.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <h3>Testing</h3>
                   <p>We test your site for accessibility, usability, and
                     compatibility.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <h3>Launching</h3>
                   <p>Congratulations! Your site is alive.</p>
