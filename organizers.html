       <p>This project is organized by Askv, Delitlabs, Makers Unite,
         Amsterdam City Rights and Foundation To Support to help
         most forgotten in the society - the Undocumented immigrants.
         Some of these people are talented and hard working individuals
         that can contribute positivly to the society. By organizing this
         project we intend to bring to the attention of the society what
         they can do if given opportunity.</p>

           <h3>Askv</h3>
           <p>ASKV / Steunpunt Refugees have been working for
             30 years for refugees and asylum seekers who have exhausted
             all legal remedies. Legal obstacles make it impossible for this
             target group to build up a social and independent existence.
             Their forced existence in the margins of society increases the
             chance of exploitation and abuse. Fear of authorities impedes
             their access to essential services such as education and medical care.
             The ASKV offers legal and social support and the Project Activation
             Undocumented provides various learning-working paths to get this
             target group back on track. In addition, there is a place where clients
             with serious medical problems can go: the Medical Reception Project
             Undocumented..</p>

           <h3>MAKERS UNITES</h3>
           <p>Makers Unite has designed an effective social inclusion programme
             based on creating sustainable products together. The act of making
             simple things in a group stimulates the collaborative engagement of
             participants. It enables dialogues that step by step build trust..</p>

             <p>In the program of Makers Unite we use these conversations to learn
               more about participants talents, develop their professional presentation
               for employers and introduce them to new opportunities as educational
               training, internships and employment.</p>

           <h3>DELITELABS</h3>
           <p>We believe in unlocking talent and self-reliance.
If you work with vulnerable people, the first thing you learn is that what “these people”
want, is not being labelled vulnerable. Therefore we avoid terms like “refugees” or “
distance to the labour market” and address our participants through their talents.</p>

<p>DELITELABS’ goal is to support aspiring entrepreneurs in developing and
  realizing professional projects and thus activating entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
