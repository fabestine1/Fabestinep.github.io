           <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
           <p>HTML5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical
             usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacement
            for common uses of generic block div and inline
            span elements, for example nav (website navigation
            block), footer (usually referring to bottom of web
            page or to last lines of HTML code), or audio and
            video instead of object.[36][37][38] Some
            deprecated elements from HTML 4.01 have been
            dropped, including purely presentational elements
            such as font and center, whose effects have
            long been superseded by the more capable
            Cascading Style Sheets.[39] There is also a
            renewed emphasis on the importance of DOM
            scripting (e.g., JavaScript) in Web behavior.</p>

           <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
           <p>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website
             design.Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes
             of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup; all font
             colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes
             had to be explicitly described, within the HTML.As a result of,
             development of large web sites, where fonts and color information
             were repeatedly added to every single page, became a long and
             expensive process.CSS solve these problems, by allowing web
             designers to move much of that formatting information to a
             separate style sheet resulting in considerably simpler HTML
             markup.</p>
